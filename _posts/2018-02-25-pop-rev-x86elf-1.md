## New Concepts Covered
* Function prologue
* Return value 
* Function epilogue

--------


We will start off this series by looking at the simplest of cases -- a program that does nothing apart from returning `0`.


**Source Code**

```c
int main()
{
	return 0;
}
```

**Disassembly**

```
0x080483db <+0>:	push   ebp
0x080483dc <+1>:	mov    ebp,esp
0x080483de <+3>:	mov    eax,0x0
0x080483e3 <+8>:	pop    ebp
0x080483e4 <+9>:	ret
```

-----------
### Function Prologue

```
0x080483db <+0>:	push   ebp
0x080483dc <+1>:	mov    ebp,esp
```

This is what we call a function prologue. It prepares the stack and registers for use within the current function. In this scenario, the old frame pointer `ebp` is being saved by pushing it onto the stack. After which, `ebp` is set up for use as `main`'s frame pointer by copying the value of `esp` into it.

### Return value

```
0x080483de <+3>:	mov    eax,0x0
```

This sets the value of `eax` to `0`. By convention, `eax` is the register that stores the return value of a function. As such, this sets the return value of `main` to `0`.

### Function epilogue

```
0x080483e3 <+8>:	pop    ebp
0x080483e4 <+9>:	ret
```

Similar to how we set up the stack and registers in the function prologue at the start of `main`, we need to perform cleanup at the end. This is done in what is called a function epilogue. In this scenario, the value of `ebp` is restored, and we execute a `ret` instruction to return to the parent function of `main`.
