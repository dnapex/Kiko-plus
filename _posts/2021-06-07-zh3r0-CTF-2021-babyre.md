This challenge provided us with a tarball. Upon unpacking it, we were presented with the following files.

```
❯ tree public/
public/
└── babyrev

0 directories, 1 file

❯ file public/babyrev
babyrev: ELF 64-bit LSB shared object, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2, BuildID[sha1]=7293f388937a500060bf95234bc5081fac41a97e, for GNU/Linux 3.2.0, stripped
```

Attempting to run the ELF file yielded the following results.

```
❯ ./babyrev
./babyrev: error while loading shared libraries: libncurses.so.6: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
```

As seen above, we were missing some dependencies required for the executable to run. Unfortunately, we couldn't fix this even after attempting to install `libncurses` and trying various fixes. Therefore, we decided to fall back on static analysis instead of wasting any further time on this.

```
s__CORRECT_PASSWORD_00102004                    XREF[1]:     FUN_00101600:0010164e(*)
00102004 20 43 4f        ds         " CORRECT PASSWORD "
         52 52 45
         43 54 20
s_INCORRECT_PASSWORD_00102017                   XREF[1]:     FUN_00101600:0010168e(*)
00102017 49 4e 43        ds         "INCORRECT PASSWORD"
         4f 52 52
         45 43 54
```

In order to efficiently narrow down which function we should be analyzing, we simply kept an eye out for any strings that indicated to us if our input was accepted. As seen above, `FUN_00101600` refers to `CORRECT PASSWORD` and `INCORRECT PASSWORD` so it's probably going to be what we wanted.

```c
void FUN_00101600(undefined8 param_1,undefined4 param_2,int param_3,undefined8 param_4)

{
  long lVar1;
  undefined8 uVar2;

  wattr_on(param_1,0x80000,0);
  lVar1 = FUN_00101560(param_4);
  if (lVar1 == 0) {
    wattr_on(param_1,0x100,0);
    mvwprintw(param_1,param_2,param_3 + 2," CORRECT PASSWORD ");
    uVar2 = 0x100;
  }
  else {
    wattr_on(param_1,0x400,0);
    mvwprintw(param_1,param_2,param_3 + 2,"INCORRECT PASSWORD");
    uVar2 = 0x400;
  }
  wattr_off(param_1,uVar2,0);
  return;
}
```

Observe that `lVar1` determines which message is printed, and is also the output of `FUN_00101560`. Also note that `param_4` is passed into `FUN_00101560` as a parameter. Hence, `param_4` is probably our input.

```c
long FUN_00101560(char *param_1)

{
  int iVar1;
  size_t sVar2;
  long lVar3;
  undefined8 uVar4;
  undefined8 *puVar5;
  undefined8 *puVar6;
  long in_FS_OFFSET;
  undefined local_58 [16];
  undefined local_48 [16];
  undefined8 local_38;
  long local_30;

  local_30 = *(long *)(in_FS_OFFSET + 0x28);
  local_58 = (undefined  [16])0x0;
  local_48 = (undefined  [16])0x0;
  sVar2 = strlen(param_1);
  lVar3 = 1;
  if (sVar2 == 0x20) {
    puVar5 = (undefined8 *)local_58;
    do {
      puVar6 = puVar5 + 1;
      uVar4 = FUN_001014d0(param_1);
      *puVar5 = uVar4;
      param_1 = param_1 + 8;
      puVar5 = puVar6;
    } while (puVar6 != &local_38);
    iVar1 = memcmp(local_58,&DAT_00104020,0x20);
    lVar3 = (long)iVar1;
  }
  if (local_30 == *(long *)(in_FS_OFFSET + 0x28)) {
    return lVar3;
  }
                    /* WARNING: Subroutine does not return */
  __stack_chk_fail();
}
```

As seen above, our input (`param_1`) is passed to `strlen` and checked if it is of length `0x20`. Otherwise, no further processing is done. Therefore, we can conclude that our input should be `32` characters. We can also see that our input is passed into `FUN_001014d0` to be processed, and then the ouput `uVar4` would be written into the location that the pointer `puVar5` points to which is `local_58`. After the loop, we `memcmp` the value of `local_58` with `DAT_00104020`. We should also note our input is processed **8 characters at a time** as seem from `param_1` = `param_1 + 8`. Let's see what `FUN_001014d0` does to our input.

```c
long FUN_001014d0(long param_1)

{
  long *plVar1;
  long *plVar2;
  ulong uVar3;
  long lVar4;
  long in_FS_OFFSET;
  undefined8 local_18;
  long local_10 [2];

  lVar4 = 0;
  local_18._0_1_ = 0;
  local_10[0] = *(long *)(in_FS_OFFSET + 0x28);
  local_18 = 0;
  while( true ) {
    plVar1 = &local_18;
    uVar3 = (ulong)*(byte *)(param_1 + lVar4);
    while( true ) {
      plVar2 = (long *)((long)plVar1 + 1);
      *(byte *)plVar1 = (byte)(((uint)uVar3 & 1) << ((byte)lVar4 & 0x1f)) | (byte)local_18;
      if (local_10 == plVar2) break;
      local_18._0_1_ = *(byte *)plVar2;
      plVar1 = plVar2;
      uVar3 = uVar3 >> 1;
    }
    lVar4 = lVar4 + 1;
    if (lVar4 == 8) break;
  }
  if (local_10[0] == *(long *)(in_FS_OFFSET + 0x28)) {
    return local_18;
  }
                    /* WARNING: Subroutine does not return */
  __stack_chk_fail();

```

Remember how we observed that our input was processed 8 bytes at a time? With reference to the code above, we can see how this actually make sense. In the main loop, our input is cast into an `unsigned long` type (8 bytes in size) as evident from `(ulong)*(byte *)(param_1 + lVar4)`. After which, we see some bit manipulation being done due to a series of bitmasks and shifts being used.

![](/images/babyre/pro-gamer-meme.png)

Instead of wasting time analyzing the all the bit manipulation, we can probably just do *black box analysis*. We have a good chance of success since all that's being done are bitmasks to select bits and shifts. Since the output is eventually compared with `DAT_00104020`, we should probably take a look at that.

```

```

If we look at the data at `DAT_00104020` as seen above, it really doesn't tell us much. This is because it does not make sense to look at it in this form. Therefore, we exported the bytes and did some processing in python.

```python
In [1]: from pwn import *

In [2]: data = 'A4ADC0A3FD7FAB00E8D5E248DABFFD00D140F2C47BBF76008707D5ADAE82FD00'

In [3]: group(16, data)
Out[3]:
['A4ADC0A3FD7FAB00',
 'E8D5E248DABFFD00',
 'D140F2C47BBF7600',
 '8707D5ADAE82FD00']

In [4]: int('A4ADC0A3FD7FAB00', 16)
Out[4]: 11866352403756329728

In [5]: bin(int('A4ADC0A3FD7FAB00', 16))[2:]
Out[5]: '1010010010101101110000001010001111111101011111111010101100000000'

In [6]: group(8, bin(int('A4ADC0A3FD7FAB00', 16))[2:])
Out[6]:
['10100100',
 '10101101',
 '11000000',
 '10100011',
 '11111101',
 '01111111',
 '10101011',
 '00000000']
 ```

We are now in a way better position to see what's being done to the bits. Logically speaking, if we assume that our input is the flag, then the bits from `zh3r0{` should be present in the bit matrix `Out[6]`.

```python
In [6]: group(8, bin(int('A4ADC0A3FD7FAB00', 16))[2:])
Out[6]:
['10100100',
 '10101101',
 '11000000',
 '10100011',
 '11111101',
 '01111111',
 '10101011',
 '00000000']

In [34]: bin(ord('z'))[2:].zfill(8)
Out[34]: '01111010'

In [35]: bin(ord('h'))[2:].zfill(8)
Out[35]: '01101000'

In [36]: bin(ord('3'))[2:].zfill(8)
Out[36]: '00110011'
```

At this point, we've effectively solved this challenge. The bits of the flag can be obtained by transposing the bit matrix in `Out[6]`. If we look at the LSB of each element in the matrix, we'd get the bits for `'z'`. The bits that form `'h'` and `'3'` can be obtained by looking at the second and third to last column accordingly.

From this point on we can just write a script to extract the flag.

```python
from pwn import *

data = "A4ADC0A3FD7FAB00E8D5E248DABFFD00D140F2C47BBF76008707D5ADAE82FD00"


def transpose(matrix):
    return [
        [matrix[j][i] for j in range(len(matrix))]
        for i in range(len(matrix[0]))[::-1]
    ]


def matrix_to_bytes(matrix):
    return "".join([chr(int("".join(x), 2)) for x in matrix])


def chunk_to_matrix(chunk):
    return [bin(x)[2:].zfill(8) for x in list(unhex(chunk)[::-1])]


def decode_chunk(chunk):
    return matrix_to_bytes(transpose(chunk_to_matrix(chunk)))


print(f'Flag: {"".join([decode_chunk(chunk) for chunk in group(16, data)])}')
```

Running the above script yields us the flag.

```
❯ python xpl.py
Flag: zh3r0{4_b4byre_w1th0ut_-O3_XDXD}
```

Flag: `zh3r0{4_b4byre_w1th0ut_-O3_XDXD}`
